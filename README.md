# Chess and Checkers Board Games in Excel

This project features interactive **Chess** and **Checkers** board games built using Microsoft Excel. The games are designed to bring a unique experience of these classic games to Excel, allowing users to play directly within the spreadsheet.

## Features
- **Fully Interactive Board**: Both Chess and Checkers boards are laid out using Excel cells.
- **Player Movements**: Players can manually move pieces within the cells by following the rules of each game.
- **Custom Formatting**: The board is color-coded to represent the traditional Chess and Checkers setup, with distinct designs for pieces.
- **Versatile for Single or Two Players**: Play against a friend or use it to practice your game strategies.

## Files
- **Chess_Game.xlsx**: Contains the Chess game setup.
- **Checkers_Game.xlsx**: Contains the Checkers game setup.

## How to Play
1. **Download the Excel file** for either Chess or Checkers.
2. **Open the file** using Microsoft Excel.
3. The game board is presented on the first sheet. Use the pre-defined cell colors to distinguish between the different pieces.
4. **Move pieces** by manually dragging them to new cells (cut and paste). Ensure you follow the movement rules for each piece:
   - For **Chess**, follow traditional piece movements for pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings.
   - For **Checkers**, move pieces diagonally and "jump" over opponents to capture.

## Rules Overview

### Chess
- Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
- Objective: Checkmate your opponent’s king.

### Checkers
- Each player begins with 12 pieces, placed on dark squares of the board.
- Objective: Capture all your opponent’s pieces or block them from making a legal move.

## Requirements
- **Microsoft Excel** (2013 or later)
- **Basic Excel Knowledge**: Familiarity with Excel cell manipulation (cut, copy, paste).

## Limitations
- No automatic rule enforcement. Players must ensure that they follow the rules manually.
- No AI or computer opponent. The game is designed for two players or solo practice.

## Future Improvements
- Automating piece movements using Excel VBA.
- Adding a move validation system to enforce the rules of each game.
- Enhancing the design to include move history tracking.
